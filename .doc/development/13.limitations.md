# Limitations

A few points to limitations on the project.

## Installation warnings when using npm

When you use npm to install some warnings appear. This is normal when using with npm.

You can ignore these warnings as it will not affect your development and build process.

### Example with npm install

```sh
3 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 1 high)

To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix

To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.
```

The reason is because some packages are outdated and have not been updated in time.

You can use **yarn** instead of npm if you get annoyed with the warnings.
