# Theme

Theming is done separetely for carbon components and custom components and are kept in sync through sass variables.

Theming for carbon tokens is found under *src/theme/themes*


```js
src
  ├── theme
    ├── themes
      ├── dark-theme.scss
      ├── ...
...
```


- Theming for custom components is done with the implementation of a palette and a **useTheme** hook explained in [Colors](./11.colors).

- Theming for carbon components is done with token overrides and explained in [Components Overrides](./12.components-overrides).

Any change will only affect carbon components. We recommend not modifying this files unless you specifically need to override carbon tokens. (If so make sure to use variables found under **src/theme/colors** so custom components can consume them if needed)

The application does not use one or the other. It uses a combination of both light and dark theme.

By default everything is rendered in light mode, this can be overwritten using the **Theme** component provided by Carbon.
